# mission-across-wales

Experimental work in progress: assess straight-line routes across Wales using geospatial data and [Edzer Pebsma's {sf} package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for R.

Inspired by Tom Davies's ([GeoWizard](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoWizard/about)) attempts to [cross Wales in a straight line on foot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_japiE6QKWphPxjqn0KJjfoRnuVSELaI).

Data from:

* the [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
* [Lle Geoportal](http://lle.gov.wales/) from the Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via the [Geofabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/) service
