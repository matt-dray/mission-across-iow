## Purposes

Experimental work in progress: an R Shiny app to let users assess the 'difficulty' of straight-line walking routes across the Isle of Wight, UK, given obstructions (waterways, buildings, barriers, etc).

Inspired by Tom '[GeoWizard](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoWizard/about)' Davies's attempts to cross countries---[like Wales](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_japiE6QKWphPxjqn0KJjfoRnuVSELaI)---in a straight line, on foot.

## Use the app

The app will be hosted on shinyapps.io when ready. In the meantime, you can test drive it with:

``` r
shiny::runGitHub(
  username = "matt-dray",
  repo = "mission-across-iow",
  subdir = "mission-across-iow",
  ref = "main"
)
```

username = "matt-dray",See the `mission-across-iow/global.R` for the packages you'll want to install.

## Development

The ultimate goal is to use Leaflet Draw with {leaflet.extras} to allow the user to draw their line onto the map. Also I'll prettify things with probably {bslib}.
