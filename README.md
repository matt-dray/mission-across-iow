[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done

Experimental work in progress: using R to assess the 'difficulty' of straight-line walking routes across the Isle of Wight, UK. 

Inspired by Tom '[GeoWizard](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoWizard/about)' Davies's attempts to cross countries---[like Wales](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_japiE6QKWphPxjqn0KJjfoRnuVSELaI)---in a straight line, on foot.

The ultimate goal is a Shiny app where the user draws a straight line onto a map and is returned the identity and count of obstructions (waterways, buildings, barriers, etc) and other data.
